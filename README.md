# Drying-Rack-GCP

The **Smart IoT Drying Rack System** is an automated solution designed to protect clothes from unpredictable weather while promoting energy efficiency and sustainability. The system integrates IoT technology with real-time weather monitoring to retract or extend the drying rack and activate a fan based on rain detection, temperature, and humidity levels. The system is aligned with **UN SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure)** and **SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)**.
